            <p id="myIntro"><strong>An adventure.</strong> In the last two weeks, I (a retiree and senior citizen) spent all day, 7-to-7, 5D a week, learning how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                    to build webpages and websites - but just the face and not the heart of it - at least, not yet! 
                    This website is the result of my efforts to learn.
            <br>
            <br>
        
            
            <p> Overall, I did enjoy the class but I also have to say that my experience or shall I say our 
                experiences (as I noticed some of us did have a rather blank expression) could have been much better. 
                Firstly, the organization of class could have been better-managed; by this I mean, 
                norvices, and probably not so tech-savvy retirees like myself should have been separated from experienced or 
                those already have
                superior knowledge and skills on using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In that way, tutors may give 
                extra attention to the weaker group. Our dedicated tutors could have been better-prepared or better-organised 
                with specific steps of learning or templates, which individuals could follow by perhaps repeating them
                on a step-by-step basis. Secondly, the teaching and learning process could have been better. 
                My understanding (and a few others) of a bootcamp course is a kind of hands-on theory-to-practice or 
                concepts-to-practice learning process. 
                Unfortunately, what I experienced was mostly self-learning. I spent most of my time watching and 
                listening to videos on Next Academy portal, which is not always easy to follow and understand. 
                Besides, there isn't enough time for me to watch 
                all the videos in that short period of time. A better alternative would have been to have a better teaching-learning process. 
                There should have been more
                specific supervised daily activities, for example, In a day, individuals could perform several steps of coding
                as targetd minimum learning outcomes for the day. After a few days or when they feel more confident
                i.e., when individuals have acquired the necessary skill, tutors can let them loose. In that way, some of us 
                could, at least go home with some skills. I know that tutors encourage participants to ask, but to be 
                honest, we don't quite know what to ask, especially in the first few days. Finally, the infrastructure 
                could have been better too. 
                Apart from a very high ratio of participants-to-tutors (20:2), the room is crowded and the temperature is 
                not well-controlled.
                Some spots are freezing while others are warm. It might also be helpful, if lecturers use a clip-on or 
                hands-free microphone so that the microphone is always close to his mouth and his hands can 
                be freed to perform other tasks such as writing or typing. As it was, the audio quality was poor, in part from 
                poor handling of microphone,
                and the rapid changes/switching 
                on the projector screen gave us a headache - we cant quite follow on what was going on on the screen.
                In conclusion, a few others and I don't think that $$$ per day is a good value-for-money proposition. In fact, 
                I just came to know of a participant who decided to break-off and left earlier.

    <div class="w3-container my thought">

        <h2 id="whyIjoined">Why did I join Next Academy bootcamp?</h2>  

    </div> 
            <br>
            <p> I'm a generation 'X' person. During my university days, I used a mannual typewriter to prepare my assignments. 
                My first experience with a computer was with Amstrad (in the UK) in the 70s and then the Apple Macintosh. 
                I only started
                using the Internet in the mid-1990s, i.e., on my return to the UK. Since then, the Internet has enjoyed massive 
                adoption and is instrumental in helping to make organizations more prominent especially in the Internet world. 
                Businesses which ignored the potential
                of the Internet did so at their own perils.
                In the past I was booged down with work and other responsibilities. I must now admit that I do not have any more excuses of 
                not having the time to learn more about the cyberworld because the world is relying more on web-driven 
                activities and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Bricks and mortars premises will become less important and offices will be 
                everywhere (mobile offices).
                 Large sucessful businesses and hence 
                customers want more tasks and processes to be done over the Internet than through traditional physical 
                face-to-face interactions. With that in mind, I am curious 
                to know how various business activities could be
                enhanced by websites, for example, on how people interactions could be managed more productively. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Besides, I feel bored a week after leaving my part-time job (did that for three years after I left my full-time job). 
                My brain is getting more inquisitive and I feel the 
                need to learn something that is not only useful but also interesting. A few years a go, I had a business concept 
                that need the use of a what I would then called a 'dynamic website' rather than a 'passive wesite', which were quite common 
                and mainly as an information portal.  
                I could not build one and so I asked a company to do it for me. They came back with a ridiculous quotation 
                which a friend of mine advised me against accepting it. I put my ideas on hold while I search for a solution. As the years went by
                the world becomes more internet-dependent and everyone can't leave home without his/her smart phone. Hmm...I thought I need to do something.
                
                Anyway, after two weeks in this bootcamp, I found that that quotation was
                a probably a 'cheat!' 
                By the way, I came to know about Next Academy from my daughter (a millennial) who, understandably, is more attuned 
                with the Internet world. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, I joined this bootcamp, primarly, to acquire the skills of building a working websites that 
                would be useful and can be monetised. 
            </p>

        <div class="w3-container benefit">
            <h2 id="benefits">Had I benefited from this boot camp?</h2>
        </div>

        <div>
            <br>   
            <p id="firstquestion">Would you like to know my rating on benefits gained? 
                <button id="firstbutton" type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("firstquestion").innerHTML 
                = "6/10"'>
                    Click Me!</button>
                </p>
        </div>
            
                
                
                <p>Yes, I did benefit mainly in terms of knowing where to find potential sources of information on the Internet 
                    (via uncle 'Google'), 
                    from which I may
                    be able to learn the 'how' to use HTML and CSS meaningfully. Har har har...in hindsight, these are things, which I 
                    could have explored on my own. The most useful experience, I would say, is probably having had the opportunity 
                    to meet new friends.  
                    To me, our tutors became more useful when we were learning JavaScript, which can
                    be a bit tricky for an 'old engine' like myself to follow the logic and to recognize or 
                    remember the various syntax, tags, and 
                    anatomy of them. But I must say after exploring and doing and repetedly doing, one begins to get-the-hang 
                    of learning HTML, CSS, and JS. It's about getting to one of those destinations via many paths. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, on the second last day of this two-week course/programme, I decided against continuing
                    with the back-end part of programme - that would have been another eight weeks of ....... 
                    At my current level of skills, I feel that that I will not benefit much 
                    and may even make me feel stressful. 
                </p>
        
            
        <div class="w3-container will do">
            <h2 id="myFutureaction">What will I do after this?</h2>
        </div>
            <br>
            <p> Should I just  quit and forget about website building? Definitely no. I will not give it up just because it 
                seems difficult, for now. I just have to find 
                another way of learning the skills of building a 'good' website. A new friend who I met in
                this programme alluded me to several sources of learning materials on self-learning. I have not explored them yet
                but will do that in the coming weeks. Let me just complete this assignment and then I will spend
                a few hours in a week to learn by doing and experimenting, preferably by the beach or up in the mountain....
            </p>
            <p>
                Would I be interested to follow up with the Back End course? Uhh.... to be honest, I am not sure yet.
                It's a great possibility. I will check with Next Academy when the time comes and to ask if they had revamped the programme.
                Let me scale up my level of skills and confidence first, including learning more on
                JavaScript or other alternative languages. I may also consider engaging a private tutor on a weekly basis. 
                In anycase, it is not that convenient for me to leave home very early in the morning and 
                to return home after 9PM. Afterall, one doesn't get to be in his 60s twice...

                Apparently, the following links provide useful guides and information on building websites. some
                of them do charge fees for certain materials but, apparently, at a very affordable price.

            <h2>Would you be interested to work with me?</h2>
        </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                Hey, would anyone be interested to work with me? I think I could do with 2-session per week of personal guidance. 
                In addition, I also would like to share a little bit of my idea of a website engine to drive a business. The truth is 
                even if I knew (and eventually I will) know how to code (I am determined to learn that) I would not have the dexterity
                to do it meticulously all on my own. I would prefer to look at the business mechanics and then manage the 
                necessary digital marketing activities to popularise the website.
            </p>
            <p> So, the conclusion is that I may like to hire and/or work with skillful coders to help me to translate my idea into a reality - 
                a working website to drive a business. Preferably, I would like them to teach me so that I can understand the coding done.
            </p>
